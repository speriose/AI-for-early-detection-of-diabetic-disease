# 🩺 AI for Early Detection of Diabetic Disease  

This project is a **deep learning–powered diagnostic tool** designed to assist in the early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide.  

Built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed through a **Flask web application**, it allows users to upload retinal images and receive instant predictions on disease presence.  

## 🔑 Key Capabilities  

- **Automated Medical Image Classification**  
  - Processes retinal fundus images and classifies them into disease categories (e.g., *Moderate*, *No_DR*).  
  - Leverages a trained deep learning model (`D_R.h5`) optimized for medical imaging tasks.  

- **Real-Time Web Deployment**  
  - Flask-based API and web interface that makes the model accessible for both clinicians and researchers.  
  - Supports image uploads and returns structured JSON outputs, including predicted class and class probabilities.  

- **Clinical Decision Support**  
  - Provides an assistive tool to help healthcare professionals identify signs of diabetic retinopathy early.  
  - Aims to reduce manual screening workload and improve patient care outcomes.  

- **Scalable & Extensible Design**  
  - Modular pipeline for integrating new models or expanding class categories.  
  - Can be extended into larger diagnostic platforms (e.g., telemedicine or hospital EMR integrations).  

## 🌟 Value Proposition  

- Demonstrates practical expertise in **AI for healthcare**, combining deep learning, data preprocessing, and web deployment.  
- Bridges **machine learning models with real-world applications** via APIs and interactive UIs.  
- Highlights strong skills in **Python (TensorFlow, Flask, NumPy)** and handling **end-to-end ML workflows** from training to deployment.  
- Potential to evolve into a full-scale **AI diagnostic assistant**, reflecting innovation, applied research, and impact in healthcare technology.
